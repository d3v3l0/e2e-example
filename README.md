# A Sample Deep Learning Platform

This repository walks through an example of what a "deep learning platform" could look like.  It uses
all open source tools:
- [Pachyderm](https://www.pachyderm.com/) to manage, version, and transform data
- [Determined](https://www.determined.ai) to train a model and manage model artifacts
- [Seldon Core](http://seldon.io/) to deploy models to Kubernetes
